# Upgrade Guide

This file provides notes on how to upgrade between versions.

## v0.5 to v0.6

### Authorizers

`AbstractAuthorizer` now has an `ErrorRepositoryInterface` instance injected via its constructor. If you are extending
this class and overloading the constructor, you will need to update your constructor to ensure the parent constructor
is called.

### Validation: Relationships

The following changes are unlikely to affect most applications. Only applications that have extended validator 
classes provided by this package or created their own implementations may be affected:

- `AcceptRelatedResourceInterface` may now return an `ErrorInterface` or `ErrorCollection` object instead of
a boolean. You'll need to update any validators that consume this interface to support these return types in
addition to a `boolean`.
- `ValidatorErrorFactoryInterface::relationshipNotAcceptable()` now takes a third argument (the custom 
error) and must return an `ErrorCollection` instance.
- Internal methods within `AbstractRelationshipValidator`, `HasOneValidator` and `HasManyValidator` have been 
re-organised to move all the validation logic into the abstract class. You will need to make changes to any validators
that extend these classes.

## v0.4 to v0.5

We decided to refactor the package, so there are a substantial amount of changes between these two versions. We
appreciate this will require some work for you to re-wire your implementations. However, the refactoring we've
done is based on us using the package in multiple production systems and represents a significant improvement
in the construction and extensibility of this package. We won't be refactoring again and we are planning on only
minor adjustments before hitting v1.0 of this package.

Note that some breaking changes were also made because the underlying `neomerx/json-api` package was upgraded from 
`v0.6.6` to `v0.8.0`.
[You may need to refer to these notes.](https://github.com/neomerx/json-api/wiki/Upgrade-Notes)

Below is a brief summary of the main changes. If you're having problems working out how to upgrade, please submit an
issue with code examples and we'll help you out.

### Framework Integration

We have removed the abstracted framework integration interfaces classes that were in the following namespaces:
- `CloudCreativity\JsonApi\Contracts\Integration`
- `CloudCreativity\JsonApi\Integration`

These overcomplicated framework integration. Each integration package should write its own integration services
that integrate with how the specific framework delivers services. We see this as advantageous because you can
write the integration in the *style* of the framework you're integrating with.

### Error Handling

The underlying `neomerx/json-api` package made substantial changes to error handling - for instance it removed
Exception renderers and introduced throwing JSON API errors via a `JsonApiException` instance.

We've kept our approach of being able to construct errors from config arrays, as this is how we prefer to define
errors within an application instance. We've made some changes to our Error object -
`CloudCreativity\JsonApi\Document\Error` which implements 
`CloudCreativity\JsonApi\Contracts\Document\MutableErrorInterface` to indicate that it is an error that has setters.

You can find an example of error configuration in the [validation error configuration file](config/validation.php)
You should use this file as the starting point for your error configuration in your application - it defines the 
errors that the validators provided by this package will produce.

Your error configuration should be loaded into an instance of `CloudCreativity\JsonApi\Repositories\ErrorRepository`.
This is the service that is used to create errors from array config. Our approach is to implement this as a service
because this allows things such as translation to occur via this service if required.

### Validators

Our validator interfaces are now in the `CloudCreativity\JsonApi\Contracts\Validators` namespace, and default 
instances are in the `CloudCreativity\JsonApi\Validators` namespace.

Previously we had a single validator interface. We now have a validator interface for each 'leaf' in the document
that is being validated. We found this is a better approach that allows each validator to be specific about which
part of the document it is validating.

In the validators namespace you'll find a `ValidatorFactory` class that implements the `ValidatorFactoryInterface`
interface. This factory can be used as a service to build the default validators that come with this package.

We've also introduced a `ValidatorProviderInterface`. The concept is that each JSON API resource type in your
application would have a validator provider instance that can provide your controller with the validators that
are specific for that resource type. We've moved to this approach because it allows us to unitize the 
creation of resource specific validators, reducing the complexity of our controller code.

### Store

We've introduced a 'store' defined via the `CloudCreativity\JsonApi\Contracts\Store\StoreInterface`. This is a simple
interface to allow validators to check that a resource type/id combination exists. 

A default store implementation is provided at `CloudCreativity\JsonApi\Store\Store`. To get this working, you need to
inject it with adapters - `CloudCreativity\JsonApi\Contracts\Store\AdapterInterface`. Adapters look up a type/id to
see if it exists and return the domain object that it refers to. Your adapters might be able to look up multiple JSON
API resource types, or you could have an adapter per type - or a combination of the two. E.g. in Laravel we have a
single adapter that can look up Eloquent models, and inject additional adapters that look up a few other resource
types that are not Eloquent models.

Your adapter tells the store whether it is handles a specified resource type via the `recognises()` method - refer
to the interface for details.
